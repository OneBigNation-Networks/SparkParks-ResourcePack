**[Click Here](https://www.github.com/OneBigNation-Networks/SparkParks-ResourcePack/releases) To view the current available pack releases for download!**

Please note that only certain types of releases where either the first or second digit of the version number changes are versions of the pack that are optimized and thoroughly compressed formats. If you run a computer that needs to use less storage space or less resources to load the resource-pack, we encourage only using these versions. For further guidance on which pack release to select, consult the table below:[^1]

### How to read Resource-Pack release versions
Release Type | Game Version | Major Release | Minor Release | Update | Build Number | *Example Format*
------------ | ------------ | :-------------: | :-------------: | :------: | ------------: | --------------- |
Experimental | `1.16.x` | `1` | `0` | `0` | B`19` | *SparkParks RP 1.16.x 1.0.0 **B19***
Patch / Update | `1.16.x` | `1` | `0` | `1` | B`01` | *SparkParks RP 1.16.x 1.0.**1** B01*

*Only Minor and Major Releases will be compressed and optimized for guest use. Patch and Experimental versions should only be used by guests looking for the in-production version of the Resource-Pack who do not mind higher resource usage or un-optimized graphics.*[^2]
